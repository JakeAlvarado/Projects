Space Invaders // Galaga Remake


This project was coded in python and is a 2D shooter where the goal is to score as many points as you can and make it as far as you can without losing 3 lives.
To play, click the play button and move the ship with your arrow keys. Space to fire. Do not let the aliens hit your ship or the bottom of the screen.

Your score and current level are on the top-right side of the screen. High score in the middle top. Lives on the top - left. Good Luck!

Press Q to quit at any time.
